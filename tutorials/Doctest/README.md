# Doctest

- The doctest module is often considered easier to use than the unittest, though the latter is more suitable for more complex tests. doctest is a test framework that comes prepackaged with Python.
- The doctest module searches for pieces of text that look like interactive Python sessions inside the documentation parts of a module, and then executes (or reexecutes) the commands of those sessions to verify that they work exactly as shown, i.e. that the same results can be achieved.
