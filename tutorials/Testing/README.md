## Unit Testing vs. Functional Testing
- **Unit tests** isolate and test individual code units to verify they function as intended. You use unit testing to verify that specific system behaviors produce the intended results. Unit tests point to a specific issue that requires fixing. Since functional testing checks the entire application, it mainly indicates a general issue without pointing out a specific problem.
- **Functional test** to check the functionalities of the entire system and ensure different components work together as intended. Its purpose is to check an entire application, including its hardware, networking infrastructure, front-end UI, and the back-end database.
- **Integration tests** check if different modules are working fine when combined together as a group.
