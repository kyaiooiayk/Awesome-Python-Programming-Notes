# How to test your python code
***

## Type of testing
- **Acceptance tests** are a quality assurance (QA) process that determines to what degree an application meets end users' approval.
- **Functional tests** check the functionalities of the entire system and ensure different components work together as intended. Theirs purpose is to check an entire application, including its hardware, networking infrastructure, front-end UI, and the back-end database.
- **Integration tests** check if different modules are working fine when combined together as a group.
- **Unit tests** isolate and test individual code units to verify they function as intended. You use unit testing to verify that specific system behaviors produce the intended results. Unit tests point to a specific issue that requires fixing. Since functional testing checks the entire application, it mainly indicates a general issue without pointing out a specific problem.
