## Unit Testing vs. Functional Testing
- Unit tests isolate and test individual code units to verify they function as intended. You use unit testing to verify that specific system behaviors produce the intended results.
- You use functional testing to check the functionalities of the entire system and ensure different components work together as intended. Its purpose is to check an entire application, including its hardware, networking infrastructure, front-end UI, and the back-end database.
- Unit tests point to a specific issue that requires fixing. Since functional testing checks the entire application, it mainly indicates a general issue without pointing out a specific problem.
