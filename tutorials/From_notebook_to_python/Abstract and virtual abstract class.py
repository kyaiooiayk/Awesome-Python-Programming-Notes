# 
# **What?** Abstract and virtual abstarct class
# 
# </font>
# </div>

# # What an abstract class is?
# <hr style = "border:2px solid black" ></hr>

# <div class="alert alert-info">
# <font color=black>
# 
# - A class is called an **abstract class** if it contains some abstract methods.
# - An **abstract method** is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation. 
# - Abstract classes may not be instantiated, and its abstract methods must be implemented by its subclasses.
# - **When are they used?** Abstract base classes provide a way to define **interfaces** when other techniques like `hasattr()` would be clumsy or subtly wrong
# 
# </font>
# </div>

# # What is a virtual abstarct class?
# <hr style = "border:2px solid black" ></hr>

# <div class="alert alert-info">
# <font color=black>
# 
# - It is everything that a normal abstract class is but it contains at least one virtual method. 
# 
# </font>
# </div>

# # Example #1
# <hr style = "border:2px solid black" ></hr>

# <div class="alert alert-info">
# <font color=black>
# 
# - The abc module defines ABCMeta class which is a metaclass for defining abstract base class. Following example defines Shape class as an abstract base class using ABCMeta. 
# - The shape class has `area()` method decorated by abstractmethod.
# - A Rectangle class now uses above Shape class as its parent and implementing the abstract `area()` method. Since it is a concrete class, it can be instantiated and an implemented `area()` method can be called. 
# - An abstract class does not require an `__init__` method, you don't need to add any constructor to it.
#     
# </font>
# </div>

# <div class="alert alert-info">

# 
# - Using this decorator requires that the classâ€™s metaclass is ABCMeta or is derived from it. 
# - A class that has a metaclass derived from ABCMeta cannot be instantiated unless all of its abstract methods and properties are overridden.
# - The following example shows this error with a concrete example.
