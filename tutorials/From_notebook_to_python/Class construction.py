# # Defining a class

# <div class="alert alert-block alert-info">

# 
# - A class is like a **blueprint** for creating an object.
# - By creating a class you render your code more manageable and more maintainable.
# - While the class is the blueprint, an **instance** is an object that is built from a class and **contains real data**.
# - Put another way, a class is like a form or questionnaire. An instance is like a form that has been filled out with information.
# 
# 
# - You can give `.__init__()` any number of parameters, but the first parameter will always be a variable called self. 
# - When a new class instance is created, the instance is automatically passed to the `self` parameter in .__init__() so that new attributes can be defined on the object.
# 
# 
# - Attributes created in .__init__() are called **instance attributes**.
# - Attributes created outside .__init__() are called **class attributes**.
# - Use class attributes to define properties that should have the same value for every class instance. Use instance attributes for properties that vary from one instance to another.

class Dog:
    # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Creates an instance attribute called name and assigns to it the value of the name parameter.
        self.name = name
        # Creates an instance attribute called age and assigns to it the value of the age parameter.
        self.age = age

    # Instance method

        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"

# - You can decided what gets printed by defining a special instance method called `.__str__()`. 
# - This message is called directly by the function `print`.
# - So instead of getting a strangle looking memory address we get a nice string.
# - **Dunder** methods because they begin and end with double underscores. There are many dunder methods that you can use to customize classes in Python.

# 
# - As you'll learn in python many things are possible but generally there is only one best pythonic way  of doing it. This is also true for attributes.
# - Attributes can be created in two ways:
#     
#     - Attributes are created inside a class definition via dunder method `__init__` and this is the pythonic way of doing it. This will also take the name object attribute as they come from a formal object created via a class instantiation.
#     - However, attribute can also be created dynamically for existing instances of a class. We do this by joining an arbitrary name to the instance name, separated by a dot `.`. This is not the way to properly create instance. Hence, it is possible to assign attributes to most class instances, but this has nothing to do with defining classes.  attributes.
