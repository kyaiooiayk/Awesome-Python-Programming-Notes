# # Basic Python Semantics: Operators

# In the previous section, we began to look at the semantics of Python variables and objects; here we'll dig into the semantics of the various *operators* included in the language.
# By the end of this section, you'll have the basic tools to begin comparing and operating on data in Python.

# ## Arithmetic Operations
# Python implements seven basic binary arithmetic operators, two of which can double as unary operators.
# They are summarized in the following table:
# 
# | Operator     | Name           | Description                                            |
# |--------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
# | ``a + b``    | Addition       | Sum of ``a`` and ``b``                                 |
# | ``a - b``    | Subtraction    | Difference of ``a`` and ``b``                          |
# | ``a * b``    | Multiplication | Product of ``a`` and ``b``                             |
# | ``a / b``    | True division  | Quotient of ``a`` and ``b``                            |
# | ``a // b``   | Floor division | Quotient of ``a`` and ``b``, removing fractional parts |
# | ``a % b``    | Modulus        | Integer remainder after division of ``a`` by ``b``     |
# | ``a ** b``   | Exponentiation | ``a`` raised to the power of ``b``                     |
# | ``-a``       | Negation       | The negative of ``a``                                  |
# | ``+a``       | Unary plus     | ``a`` unchanged (rarely used)                          |
# 
# These operators can be used and combined in intuitive ways, using standard parentheses to group operations.
# For example:

# In[1]:


# addition, subtraction, multiplication
(4 + 8) * (6.5 - 3)


# Floor division is true division with fractional parts truncated:

# In[2]:


# True division
print(11 / 2)


# In[3]:


# Floor division
print(11 // 2)


# The floor division operator was added in Python 3; you should be aware if working in Python 2 that the standard division operator (``/``) acts like floor division for integers and like true division for floating-point numbers.
# 
# Finally, I'll mention an eighth arithmetic operator that was added in Python 3.5: the ``a @ b`` operator, which is meant to indicate the *matrix product* of ``a`` and ``b``, for use in various linear algebra packages.

# ## Bitwise Operations
# In addition to the standard numerical operations, Python includes operators to perform bitwise logical operations on integers.
# These are much less commonly used than the standard arithmetic operations, but it's useful to know that they exist.
# The six bitwise operators are summarized in the following table:
# 
# | Operator     | Name            | Description                                 |
# |--------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
# | ``a & b``    | Bitwise AND     | Bits defined in both ``a`` and ``b``        |
# | <code>a &#124; b</code>| Bitwise OR      | Bits defined in ``a`` or ``b`` or both      |
# | ``a ^ b``    | Bitwise XOR     | Bits defined in ``a`` or ``b`` but not both |
# | ``a << b``   | Bit shift left  | Shift bits of ``a`` left by ``b`` units     |
# | ``a >> b``   | Bit shift right | Shift bits of ``a`` right by ``b`` units    |
# | ``~a``       | Bitwise NOT     | Bitwise negation of ``a``                          |
# 
# These bitwise operators only make sense in terms of the binary representation of numbers, which you can see using the built-in ``bin`` function:

# In[4]:


bin(10)


# The result is prefixed with ``'0b'``, which indicates a binary representation.
# The rest of the digits indicate that the number 10 is expressed as the sum $1 \cdot 2^3 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^0$.
# Similarly, we can write:

# In[5]:


bin(4)


# Now, using bitwise OR, we can find the number which combines the bits of 4 and 10:

# In[6]:


4 | 10


# In[7]:


bin(4 | 10)


# These bitwise operators are not as immediately useful as the standard arithmetic operators, but it's helpful to see them at least once to understand what class of operation they perform.
# In particular, users from other languages are sometimes tempted to use XOR (i.e., ``a ^ b``) when they really mean exponentiation (i.e., ``a ** b``).

# ## Assignment Operations
# We've seen that variables can be assigned with the "``=``" operator, and the values stored for later use. For example:

# In[8]:


a = 24
print(a)


# We can use these variables in expressions with any of the operators mentioned earlier.
# For example, to add 2 to ``a`` we write:

# In[9]:


a + 2


# We might want to update the variable ``a`` with this new value; in this case, we could combine the addition and the assignment and write ``a = a + 2``.
# Because this type of combined operation and assignment is so common, Python includes built-in update operators for all of the arithmetic operations:

# In[10]:


a += 2  # equivalent to a = a + 2
print(a)


# There is an augmented assignment operator corresponding to each of the binary operators listed earlier; in brief, they are:
# 
# |||||
# |-|-|
# |``a += b``| ``a -= b``|``a *= b``| ``a /= b``|
# |``a //= b``| ``a %= b``|``a **= b``|``a &= b``|
# |<code>a &#124;= b</code>| ``a ^= b``|``a <<= b``| ``a >>= b``|
# 
# Each one is equivalent to the corresponding operation followed by assignment: that is, for any operator "``■``", the expression ``a ■= b`` is equivalent to ``a = a ■ b``, with a slight catch.
# For mutable objects like lists, arrays, or DataFrames, these augmented assignment operations are actually subtly different than their more verbose counterparts: they modify the contents of the original object rather than creating a new object to store the result.

# ## Comparison Operations
# 
# Another type of operation which can be very useful is comparison of different values.
# For this, Python implements standard comparison operators, which return Boolean values ``True`` and ``False``.
# The comparison operations are listed in the following table:
# 
# | Operation     | Description                       || Operation     | Description                          |
# |---------------|-----------------------------------||---------------|--------------------------------------|
# | ``a == b``    | ``a`` equal to ``b``              || ``a != b``    | ``a`` not equal to ``b``             |
# | ``a < b``     | ``a`` less than ``b``             || ``a > b``     | ``a`` greater than ``b``             |
# | ``a <= b``    | ``a`` less than or equal to ``b`` || ``a >= b``    | ``a`` greater than or equal to ``b`` |
# 
# These comparison operators can be combined with the arithmetic and bitwise operators to express a virtually limitless range of tests for the numbers.
# For example, we can check if a number is odd by checking that the modulus with 2 returns 1:

# In[11]:


# 25 is odd
25 % 2 == 1


# In[12]:


# 66 is odd
66 % 2 == 1


# We can string-together multiple comparisons to check more complicated relationships:

# In[13]:


# check if a is between 15 and 30
a = 25
15 < a < 30


# And, just to make your head hurt a bit, take a look at this comparison:

# In[14]:


-1 == ~0


# Recall that ``~`` is the bit-flip operator, and evidently when you flip all the bits of zero you end up with -1.
# If you're curious as to why this is, look up the *two's complement* integer encoding scheme, which is what Python uses to encode signed integers, and think about what happens when you start flipping all the bits of integers encoded this way.

# ## Boolean Operations
# When working with Boolean values, Python provides operators to combine the values using the standard concepts of "and", "or", and "not".
# Predictably, these operators are expressed using the words ``and``, ``or``, and ``not``:

# In[15]:


x = 4
(x < 6) and (x > 2)


# In[16]:


(x > 10) or (x % 2 == 0)


# In[17]:


not (x < 6)


# Boolean algebra aficionados might notice that the XOR operator is not included; this can of course be constructed in several ways from a compound statement of the other operators.
# Otherwise, a clever trick you can use for XOR of Boolean values is the following:

# In[18]:


# (x > 1) xor (x < 10)
(x > 1) != (x < 10)


# These sorts of Boolean operations will become extremely useful when we begin discussing *control flow statements* such as conditionals and loops.
# 
# One sometimes confusing thing about the language is when to use Boolean operators (``and``, ``or``, ``not``), and when to use bitwise operations (``&``, ``|``, ``~``).
# The answer lies in their names: Boolean operators should be used when you want to compute *Boolean values (i.e., truth or falsehood) of entire statements*.
# Bitwise operations should be used when you want to *operate on individual bits or components of the objects in question*.

# ## Identity and Membership Operators
# 
# Like ``and``, ``or``, and ``not``, Python also contains prose-like operators  to check for identity and membership.
# They are the following:
# 
# | Operator      | Description                                       |
# |---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
# | ``a is b``    | True if ``a`` and ``b`` are identical objects     |
# | ``a is not b``| True if ``a`` and ``b`` are not identical objects |
# | ``a in b``    | True if ``a`` is a member of ``b``                |
# | ``a not in b``| True if ``a`` is not a member of ``b``            |

# ### Identity Operators: "``is``" and "``is not``"
# 
# The identity operators, "``is``" and "``is not``" check for *object identity*.
# Object identity is different than equality, as we can see here:

# In[19]:


a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]


# In[20]:


a == b


# In[21]:


a is b


# In[22]:


a is not b


# What do identical objects look like? Here is an example:

# In[23]:


a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
a is b


# The difference between the two cases here is that in the first, ``a`` and ``b`` point to *different objects*, while in the second they point to the *same object*.
# As we saw in the previous section, Python variables are pointers. The "``is``" operator checks whether the two variables are pointing to the same container (object), rather than referring to what the container contains.
# With this in mind, in most cases that a beginner is tempted to use "``is``" what they really mean is ``==``.

# ### Membership operators
# Membership operators check for membership within compound objects.
# So, for example, we can write:

# In[24]:


1 in [1, 2, 3]


# In[25]:


2 not in [1, 2, 3]
