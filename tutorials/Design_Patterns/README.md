## Three types of design patterns
- **Creational Design Patterns** provide essential information regarding the Class instantiation or the object instantiation. 
- **Structural Design Patterns** are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- **Behavioral Design Patterns** are all about identifying the common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.
